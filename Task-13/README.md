## What did I do?
I learnt how to use arduino and tinkercad through my daily classes in amrita. So i tried doing this task, I was able to detect whether the obstacle was within 100cm distance or not but I couldn't figure out how to stop the motion of the motor.
So, I was not able to complete the task.
But i learnt how to use ultrasensor and buzzer.
