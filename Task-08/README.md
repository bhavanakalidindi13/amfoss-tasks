## What did I do?

I followed google and found out about perceval tool, json and os libraries and used them to fetch the commits from amfoss organisation.
The only thing is that there were 33 repos in the organisation but i got only 30 repos commits.
I am not sure why.
I learnt a lot from it.
But i definitely didn't go into it too much only the commands which i required.
