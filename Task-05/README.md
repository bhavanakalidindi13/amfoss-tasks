## What did I do?
When I first read the task, my only concentration was on scraping, so I searched about it in google.
Through google i found out about Beautifulsoup in python, which is used for web scraping, i went on and learnt the basic commands and searched many websites on how to do this task.
I saw many codes on it which used libraries like requests, pandas, csv, beautifulsoup etc.
 
 Then I went on to the worldometer website and tracked down the code which i required and wrote the code, I got many errors and it took one whole day but i was still not able to do it.
 Then we had a team meeting where our mentor told that we should use Rust, that moment i felt like i an idiot for not notiicng it before when the whole time i wondered why the task was called Rustic Scraper but yes then i thought of doing it but kept it for later after doing the tasks which i was working on.
 
 I definitely learned a lot even though i couldn't complete the task. Webscraping itself was a very new term for me then i also learnt about few libraries so it was definitely not a waste of time.
