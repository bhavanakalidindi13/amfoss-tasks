# Introspection

### Why must we choose you?
I will do my best in completing the given tasks and i am looking forward to learn new stuff on joining this club.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I would like to learn as much as i can and study well.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
I may not know many things but i would help others as much as i can from whatever i know.

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
I don't know much about the selection process but as far as i know i think the process is good because one can understand whether the person is actually willing to learn or will do hardwork or not and whether they like coding or not etc. through this process.
