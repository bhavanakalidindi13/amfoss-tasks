## My views on all these tasks

All the tasks were interesting and I learnt many things, even if there were tasks for which I was not able to find the solutions
I definitely learnt a lot. 

## How it helped me?

Everyday when I did these tasks i learned something new in coding. Discord and Git were something I heard for the first time through this club. So, even before attempting the tasks I learnt about two new things. The journey so far was really good.
Not only that it also helped me on personal level like I am basically an introvert person and I never message in groups. I guess my first group message was on machamp in discord. I never thought I will be able to speak up and ask doubts which I never do, not even in my classes but I did it here. So, this definitely helped me a lot. I am looking forward to what more I could learn from this club and wish to be a part of it.
