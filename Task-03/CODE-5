## JACK JACK CODES
#### Code
I got terminated to due to time out, i found out that i should use a different approach instead of using many loops but i didn't get an idea on what should be done.
The code below is the one which got timed out(got 70 points).

x=input()
x=x.split()
a=int(x[0])
b=int(x[1])
y=[int(i) for i in input().split()]
flag = 0
for i in y:
    p = b-i
    if(p in y):
        flag = 1
        break
if(flag == 1):
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
