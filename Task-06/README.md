## What did I do?
After reading the task, I learnt go language through the tutorial given in the reference links in the task.
i completed the tutorial. I also created an account in reddit. But due to lack of time i was not able to go any further.
I only knew few languages like python , c ,c++ , java etc. but i found out about go language through this task and also about reddit.
