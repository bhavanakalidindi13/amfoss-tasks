##Problem Faced
I faced time out errors in 1st and 4th problems.

## Solution
I found out that the error occurred because of usage of many loops.
Therefore, in 1st problem instead of using loops I used division.
In 4th problem instead of running code again and again for finding palindrome I created a list of palindromes.

## What I learned?
I always approach a solution with many loops in it. The code is correct but it takes time. So I learned how to approach a code with less loops.
It helped me in finding solutions with less complexity and also helped in thinking different ways to find a solution.
